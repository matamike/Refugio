# Refugio
Refugio is the Master thesis project that I have been working for 9 months along with game designer. It's refugee camp management simulation game with city builder mechanics.

Controls : 

Hold and drag MMB to navigate through the scene of the game or (W,A,S,D).

Use RMB to rotate around the Camera focus point.

Use “E” or LMB when in the Waiting Area structure after you choose to allocate a new refugee to a tent (house). 
Please Note: If you press E in a target other than an available tent (has enough space), the progress is reset.

Press U to redirect the camera to focus on one of the structures when far away.
Press R to reset the camera position back to the original. (By Hold / Drag MMB and/or WASD the action is stopped.)
Press M to open/close Agreements Menu.
